## My process

### Built with

- Next.js
- Tailwindcss
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned how to make a tailwind styled component non-responsive so it looks the same on mobile and desktop, by using a fixed width style like w-96 in the top level div.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to use props if the project has multiple components that are similar.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This is a must to have open while developing to look up what tailwind classes are available.
